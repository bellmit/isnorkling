This is an implementation for a solution to the iSnork simulation game 
for the class COMS4444 Programming and Problem Solving.

It implements four sub-strategies: exploration, communication, 
danger avoidance, and returning. An overall utility function controls
the weight on each of these four sub-strategies as game progresses.

This is a general solution that we feel works well on most types
of boards.
